## School Performance Analysis

This analysis aims to provide insights into school performance based on two key factors: spending per student and school size. The analysis evaluates the average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall performance.

Schools with a lower per student budget tend to have higher average math and reading scores and higher overall passing rates.
Smaller schools tend to outperform larger schools in terms of average scores and passing rates.

Smaller schools tend to create an environment conducive to higher academic achievement and student success.
School size optimization and targeted budget allocation can significantly impact student performance and overall school success.

Schools with a lower per student budget tend to have higher average math and reading scores and higher overall passing rates.
